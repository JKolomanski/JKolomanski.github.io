          Hi, My name is Jakub Kołomański and welcome to my website! I'm an 18
          year old amateur programmer and technology and IT enthusiast,
          currently I'am living in Radwanice, a small town near the city of
          Wrocław in Poland.<br />
          <br />
          On the right you can see my photo! ( I'm beautiful, I know )<br />
          <br />
          Here are some links, one to my GitHub account and the other to copy my
          email to your clipboard:
        </p>
        <div class="links">
          <button class="page-button" onclick="copyEmailToClipboard()">
            Email
          </button>
          <button class="page-button" onclick="githubButtonClicked()">
            Github
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="aboutCard">
        <h2 class="cardTitle">About this site</h2>
        <p>
          This is my personal wabpage! The project was started on february 4th,
          2023 and currently it's still under construction. The goal is to use
          it as a learning tool to help me learn basics of web development. In
          the future I also plan to use it as a place to showcase some of my
          other projects. Kind of like a project portfolio. Currently you can
          visit the "Projects" tab and take a look at some of them, Have fun!
